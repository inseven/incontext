# This script serves as a runner for iOS and macOS project build jobs that ensures the 'changes' and 'build-tools'
# commands are available on the path, and that a temporary keychain has been set up for development (and will be cleaned
# up automatically on success or failure of the child script.
#
# It exports the following environment variables to the child script:
#
# - KEYCHAIN_PATH - the path of the temporary keychain
# - IOS_XCODE_PATH - the path of Xcode to use for iOS builds
# - MACOS_XCODE_PATH - the path of Xcode to use for macOS builds
